As 2020 is drawing to a close, many of us are looking toward the New Year with anticipation of working from home. The pandemic has changed the landscape of working professionals around the world and many have already adapted to this new lifestyle.

## Types Of Work

Certainly, working from home is not for everyone and not everyone is qualified to work from home. Most of the jobs that are allowing work to be conducted from home have very strict requirements as to what can and cannot be done from home.

Special internet and phone requirements must be met before most people can begin working from home. These usually include having a fast internet connection, a reliable computer (some employers provide these) and a good phone connection.

> If working remotely is such a great idea, why isn't everyone doing it? I think it's because we've been bred on the idea that work happens from 9 to 5, in offices and cubicles. It's no wonder that most who are employed inside that model haven't considered other options, or resist the idea that it could be any different. But it can. - Jason Fried

Software developers are among many people who have found themselves working from home. Graphic designers, UI/UX specialists, etc. all seem to be able to collaborate with team members to get jobs done.
