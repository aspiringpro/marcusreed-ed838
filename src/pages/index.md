        content: >-
          Design is an essential part of what I do. I am skilled with popular
          graphic design softwares including most Adobe products and am also a
          big fan of open-source software such as GIMP and Inkscape.  I enjoy
          designing things like logos, flyers, website graphics, banners, menus,
          stickers, buttons, etc. I am a fan of clean and simple designs, but if
          loud and bold is your style, then I can certainly adapt my personal
          style to fit your needs.

          fastest, most user-friendly websites and apps for my clients.  Take
          solice in the fact that the site or application that I develop for
          you, will be elegant, functional, blazing-fast, and extremely
          effective.

      - title: Branding
        content: >-
          Branding involves much more than a designing a pretty logo and a fancy
          website. Colors, fonts, and slick graphics don't mean anything if they
          are not put together with a brand identity and strategy in mind.  Let
          me help deliver a cohesive brand experience to your consumers that
          seperates you from the competition.
